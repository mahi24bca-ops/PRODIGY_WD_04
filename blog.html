    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Mahi Hathiyani</strong>, a passionate BCA student and aspiring software developer. My journey into coding started with curiosity during my early academic years, and since then it has grown into a deep interest in solving real-world problems through technology.

Over the course of my studies, I have explored a wide range of programming languages and tools — from building interactive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to developing dynamic applications using React, and working with databases through PHP & MySQL. I also have experience in Java and Python, which has helped me strengthen my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Beyond academics, I enjoy experimenting with new frameworks, learning about full-stack development, and creating projects that not only sharpen my skills but also reflect my creativity and dedication. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to impactful projects that make a difference in people's lives.

I strongly believe in continuous learning, teamwork, and the power of technology to shape the future. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far, my projects, and the skills I’ve developed along the way. I’m always excited to learn, build, and grow.</p>
